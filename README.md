# Advanced_Programming-Exam
The current repository contains the final project for Advanced Programming exam by Eleonora Donadini and Valeria Paolucci.

The C++ folder contains the part of the project related to c++, this includes:
1. the implementation of a template binary search tree class (BinTree class) in the **BinTree.h** file;
2. the test code **Test.cc** used to test the functionality of our binary tree implementation, that can be compiled exploiting the provided **Makefile**;
3. the **report** in which we describe the structure of our implementation and the performance lookups test;
4. the folder **Benchmark** that contains the code **Benchmark.cc** to test the performance of the lookups (using the function find) before and after the tree is re-balanced and also to test the performance of the lookups for the std::map.

The Python folder contains:
1. a .py file named **exam_solution.py**, in which we implemented the PostcardsList class;
2. the **exam_requests.py** file, containing all the specifications about the assignment and the relevant tests imported from the module unittest;
3. the ten properly formatted files we were provided with, containing the postcards.
