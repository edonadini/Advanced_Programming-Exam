# Advanced_Programming-Exam
Final project for Advanced Programming exam (Valeria Paolucci and Eleonora Donadini)

The C++ folder contains the part of the project related to c++, this includes:
1. the implementation of a template binary search tree class (BinTree class) in the BinTree.h file;
2. the folder Benchmark that contains the code Benchmark.cc to test the performance of the looksup (using the function find) before and after the tree is re-balanced and also to test the performance of the looksup for the std::map;
3. the report in wich we describe the structure of our implementation and the performance looksup test;
4. the test code Test.cc use to test the funtonality of our binary tree implementation, that can be compiled exploiting the provided Makefile.

The Python folder contains:
1. a .py file named “exam_solution.py”, in which we implemented the PostcardsList class;
2. the “exam_requests.py” file, containing all the specifications about the assignment and the relevant tests imported from the module unittest;
3. the ten properly formatted files we were provided with, containing the postcards.
