# C++ project

This folder contains the C++ project.

We are required to implement a non-autobalancing Binary Search Tree (details are contained in the Report file).

The BinTree class is implemented in the BinTree.h file, while the file Test.cc is used to check that all is working fine.

Test.cc can be compiled exploiting the provided Makefile.
